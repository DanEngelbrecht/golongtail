          Changes in this Release
          - **FIX** Make sure flush also flushes store index, empties preflight memory and flushes any pending preflight blocks.
          - **FIX** Build Linux executable using Ubuntu 18.04 to avoid forcing update of GLIBC dependency
          - **CHANGED** Removed unused `--target-chunk-size` option for downsync
          - **CHANGED** Removed unused `--target-block-size` option for downsync
          - **CHANGED** Removed unused `--max-chunks-per-block` option for downsync
          - **CHANGED** `--target-path` for `downsync` command is now optional and if not given a folder will be crated in the current directory based on the source name
          - **CHANGED** `--source-zip-paths` option in `cloneStore` is no longer required
          - **CHANGED** Now uses Kong command line parser instead of Kingpin/v2
          - **ADD** s3-blobstore, use the uri format s3:// for Amazon S3 stores
          - **ADD** `cloneStore` command to copy all versions from one store to a new store
          - **ADD** `pruneStore` command that removes blocks of data base on which blocks are used by a list of version indexes
          - **ADD** `get` command to use json formatted config file to avoid specifying all the source information options, generate with `--get-config-path` option in `upsync` command
          - **ADD** `printStoreIndex` now has `-details` option that shows how much data (both total and unique) is in a store
          - **UPDATE** Update dependencies, in particular GCS dependency to fix oauth compatability
          - **UPDATE** Build using Golang 1.17.1
          - **UPDATE** Update to longtail v0.2.4
